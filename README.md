Swift Notes
===

* Unary operators
  * Unary Minus Operator
    ```
	let x = 3
	let minusX = -x // minusX equals -3
	let plusX = -minusX // plusX equals 3
    ```

    **Note: Prepended directly before the value it operates on, without any white space**

  * Unary Plus Operator
    ```
	let y = -3
	let plusY = +y // plusY still equals -3
    ```

    **Note: Plus unary operator do nothing, except for providing symmetry :)**
